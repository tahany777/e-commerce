* Axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node. js. Axios makes it easy to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints and perform CRUD operations. It can be used in plain JavaScript or with a library such as Vue or React.

* Bulma is a CSS library. This means it provides CSS classes to help you style your HTML code.
To use Bulma, you can either use the pre-compiled .css file or install the .sass files so you can customize it to your needs.
